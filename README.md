The first part of the assignment consists of writing a python script that maps a gene sequence into its corresponding protein sequence.\
    Three input files are needed for this assignment:\
    1.gene_sequence.txt: the nucleotide sequence of the gene in question.\
    2.exon_position.txt: contains the start and end positions of the exon regions. Each line holds the start and end positions of an exon region.\
    3.code.txt: contains the mapping of mRNA triplets to amino acids. The first column is the mRNA triplet, while the other columns represents the 1-letter symbol, a 3-letter name, and the full name of the corresponding amino acid.\
    \
    \
    The second part consists of computing some statistics about the content in amino acids of the protein sequence that was previously obtained.\
    \
    \
    The last part of the assignment is to investigate a human disease related to the gene in question.
